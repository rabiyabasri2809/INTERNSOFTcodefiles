    "# Introduction to Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "**pandas** is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to work with *relational* or *labeled* data both. It is a fundamental high-level building block for executing practical, real world data analysis in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "pandas is well suited for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet\n",
    "- Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data.\n",
    "- Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and column labels\n",
    "- Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data actually need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data structure\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Easy handling of **missing data**\n",
    "- **Size mutability**: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects\n",
    "- Automatic and explicit **data alignment**: objects can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the data can be aligned automatically\n",
    "- Powerful, flexible **group by functionality** to perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets\n",
    "- Intelligent label-based **slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting** of large data sets\n",
    "- Intuitive **merging and joining** data sets\n",
    "- Flexible **reshaping and pivoting** of data sets\n",
    "- **Hierarchical labeling** of axes\n",
    "- Robust **IO tools** for loading data from flat files, Excel files, databases, and HDF5\n",
    "- **Time series functionality**: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear regressions, date shifting and lagging, etc."
